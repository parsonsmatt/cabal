When `cabal` clones a Git repo for a `source-repository-package` listed in a
`cabal.project`, it will run various commands to check out the correct
revision, initialize submodules if they're present, and so on.

Now, `cabal` will pass `--quiet` to Git in more cases to help prevent
cluttering command-line output.
